## Overall plot description:

Googoo gaga

Joseph, 27, after his long law studies, finds himself alone in the house of his recently deceased grandmother, where he has just moved on a whim. Unemployed in a professionally dead-end environment, he mopes about his life choices.

He is accompanied by his childhood friend and college buddy, Lucas. They see each other regularly and try to motivate each other to get some fresh air, but always end up spending their evenings drinking and lamenting their existence.

In any case, Joseph has never been particularly interested in earthly desires. They have never really moved him, and he couldn't care less. His relatives have already arranged dates for him, but without success.

  

In order to find a purpose in life, he goes to the local church.

Once there, he meets Cesare, the charismatic priest known for his generosity and kindness in volunteering in the community, such as distributing meals to people in financial difficulty and raising funds for the urbanization of the city. He develops an obsession with this person and what he represents, his role model, this paragon of success.

  

However, due to hanging around him, thanks to whispers in the church and gossip in the local café, he begins to hear rumors about the perfect Father Cesare. Allegedly, he had put up this facade of a good Samaritan to hide his past as a sinner: addiction to gambling, alcohol, and thrills.

He had been caught several times observing and spying on people's homes at night and had even committed several public indecent acts, masturbating in front of passersby. Intrigued, he investigated Cesare's past, using his connections at the local police station, thanks to his friend who was a police officer, to search his criminal record, then clean.

  

Determined, he decides to dig deeper and spy on Cesare in the church. He arms himself with his camera and follows Cesare everywhere, taking photos of his acquaintances and the places he frequents so that he can note them down and pin them to a corkboard. Unfortunately or fortunately, he follows Cesare to his home and takes a photo of him in an attempt to find out more about him, but unfortunately ends up photographing him naked. Ashamed of his mistake, he hastily deletes the photos. Or at least, that's what he wanted to do. He can't bring himself to press the delete button. He puts the camera away.

He concludes that his investigation is going nowhere and that he needs to go to the source.

  

To question him away from prying eyes, he pretends to want to atone for his sins and confesses to Father Cesare. So in the confessional, he pretends to have committed sins similar to the rumors about Cesare in order to unsettle the priest, but ends up confiding his concerns about life. Throughout this, Joseph can hear weird sounds coming from the next booth during the confession, but they eventually subside when the priest confides about his life and concerns.

He understands Joseph's situation and shows great empathy towards him, comforting him. Unfortunately, having more urgent obligations, he eventually leaves. Exhausted from this exchange and with his insomnia spent obsessing over him, he falls asleep in the booth.

As a result, he reopens his eyes late at night, in the darkness, awakened by the sound of footsteps and the voices of the priests, including Cesare's. To his horror, he discovers that the Fathers are heading towards the stalls, including the one where Joseph is; and, panicked, he hides under the seat, which miraculously seems to have enough room for his body. Thanks to the darkness, when Cesare, lit only by candlelight, enters the cabin, he does not notice him. This allows Joseph to listen to Cesare's confessions to the other priest. He confesses that he recently spied on a new supporter of the church while he was changing and that he could no longer stop himself from doing so. Joseph is stunned to discover that Cesare does not seem to regret his actions in the slightest. His curiosity prompts him to peek out of his hiding place and he notices that Cesare is not wearing any underwear... Shocked and horrified, he realizes that this situation excites him like never before in his life, revealing feelings he has never felt before.

Finally, at the end of the confessions, the other priest leaves and Cesare lingers in the booth before finally leaving. Joseph, relieved, begins to come out of his hiding place, but Cesare reopens the confessional and grabs Joseph. 

What follows is one of the most embarrassing and painful moments the snoop has ever experienced, confronted by the Father's firm grip. They stare each other down. Joseph doesn't really know how to react to this situation. He is like a deer caught in the headlights. Not knowing what to say, the silence continues. It is finally broken by Cesare, who asks him sharply what he is doing in the confessional. Joseph avoids his gaze, ashamed. Cesare asks again more insistently, calling him a dirty sinner. At this comment, Joseph mutters under his breath that he is not the biggest sinner of the two. He takes the opportunity to free himself from Cesare's grip. He stood frozen for a moment, confused about what to do next. Finally, he decided to leave and hurried away.

However, Cesare blocked his path and told him to cut the crap and be honest. Cesare then told Joseph that he had known all along that Joseph was in the cabin, but he had left him there. He confesses that he knew that from this angle, Joseph would see his family jewels, that this was his intention, and that he was euphoric to have finally found a fisherman like himself. At that moment, Joseph, in shock and fear, struggling to stammer a few words, with Cesare following close behind, backs up and bumps into the confessional. Unexpectedly, Cesare illuminates his crotch and points to the preliminary semen stain on his pants, remarking that he loved it. Then he grabs his crotch and massages it. Joseph can't help but moan, and strong emotions flood his head. He can no longer see clearly and begins to breathe heavily.

Cesare asks him if he feels congested down there and tells him he's going to help him. Then Cesare undoes his belt.

At that moment, overwhelmed by all the stimuli and what he is feeling, he closes his eyes and concentrates on catching his breath, anticipating that Cesare is playing with his cock, hoping for it deep down. Only after unbearable seconds does he no longer feel anything and manages to catch his breath.

But he is interrupted by Cesare exclaiming that he really wasn't lying about what Joseph had said in the confessional. Taken aback, Joseph opens his eyes again and sees Cesare fiddling with his camera. Joseph looks down in horror and notices that his camera is no longer in his pocket and, even more disturbingly, that his pants are around his knees with his penis half-erect, hanging in the air, with a thin string. Cesare shows him the image of himself naked. Joseph freezes in shame, guilt, and fear. He should have deleted those damn photos when he could.

Then Cesare tells him to say “Cheese” and takes a photo of him without his consent, impromptu. Then, an image of him naked, exposing his penis, appears on the camera. Cesare declares that the town would be disgusted to know that Joseph is just a perverted little sinner photographing poor Father Cesare and that he forces him to look at his genitals.

Joseph comes back to reality and, in a burst of energy, throws himself at Cesare to take the camera back. With only his pants around his knees, he ends up tripping. Cesare advises him to stay calm. If he keeps what he saw tonight to himself and follows him without making a fuss, he can have his camera back. He also scolds him and demands that he behave himself and pull up his pants. Joseph gets up and does as he is told.

Cesare heads for the exit, camera in hand. Joseph looks around for an exit, wondering if he could just leave, but Cesare catches his attention by waving the camera at him and tucks it under his tunic. Joseph feels compelled to follow him, hoping to get his belongings back. Cesare makes him get into his car, and they set off.

Throughout the journey, Joseph fears for his life, thinking that Cesare is going to take him back to his house to hold him captive or take him to a remote location to get rid of him. However, Cesare drops him off at his house and arranges to meet him at the café the next day, implying that if he doesn't come, he will make Joseph's actions public.

Unable to sleep, he calls Lucas in the middle of the night and begs him to come to his house, thinking he will tell him everything. However, once Lucas arrives at the house, Joseph cannot muster the courage to tell him about the previous day's events and just breaks down in tears. Seeing this, Lucas hugs him. Lucas spends the night at Joseph's house.

The next day, Joseph goes to the café, where Cesare is waiting for him. He asks him philosophical questions such as “What do you think of God?” and “Does fate exist?” Finally, he suggests that they become partners and explore their sinful desires together, since they are cut from the same cloth, and he does so with contagious enthusiasm.

His speech overwhelms him and, confronted with what he felt in the café the day before, he screams in the café that he is not a monster. After calming down, he admits to Cesare that he lied in the confessional and that it was for his investigation and the photos. After his revelations, Cesare is livid, disgusted, and speechless. He throws his camera at him and tells him to do whatever he wants with it, he doesn't care anymore.

There follows a period where Cesare and Joseph no longer see each other, as Joseph no longer attends church. However, Joseph misses the new feelings he discovered during that night in the church. On a rainy day (cliché, I know), Joseph goes to Cesare's house and accepts Cesare's proposal to become his partner.

Together, they explore their deviance as if exploring the forest together naked.
