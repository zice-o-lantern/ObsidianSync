### Master Analysis - Head

![Steve huston head master 1.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Steve%20huston%20head%20master%201.png)

Notice the curvature of the center line. Instead of an egg, you can do a pill shape, which can help indicate the tilting position.  
The facial features form a parallel. This could be broken with asymmetry, which creates dynamics and interest.

Don't confuse the mask of the face as the entire head. The hair covers the cranium and reflects the full skull. Visualize what you can't see.

Extending the **brow line towards the ear** gives you the lean of the head. Adding the **eyebrow line** to this gives you immediate dimensionality.

The neck comes out from the underside of the chin.

Following the eyebrow leads to where the cheekbone meets the lower lid, which moves down towards the lips. This becomes a natural corner of the head.

Don't stress over getting things accurate. They can be sculpted later, like clay.

The artist's job is to relate things with each other. _This to that._ Parts that relate to the whole. Gesture connects everything.

![Steve huston head master 3.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Steve%20huston%20head%20master%203.png)

Get the center line, and look at the distance between it and the short side. Find how the head relates to the neck.

Eggs and tubes also work for the head, and they make the head look rounder. The features wrap around the curvature. You can indicate facial features with placeholder shapes, areas where they will sit on.

Drapery follows the gesture and structure of the body it sits on.

From the back the head is a ball. The neck can create a graceful opposing curves against the torso. Ears are good indicators of the position.

### Master Analysis - Torso

![Steve huston torso master 1.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Steve%20huston%20torso%20master%201.png)

Draw the torso in relation to the head. Draw the head first. Always look to see how the head flows into the neck. Sometimes the chin can be ignored for this.

Segment a curve into straights to better figure out its subtlety. Trying to draw it in one go is unlikely to succeed.

Visualize the torso without the shoulders, use the waist instead. The torso's tube follows the center line.  
Look how the anatomy and details moves right over the structure. **Movement over the form**.

The hip is squishing and is much wider. The hip is a squishy, bulging box. It is often obscured by legs and waist. It is the root of the body so suggesting its structure is important.

You can cut through the shoulders and visualize a coke bottle. This makes clear how the neck connects to the torso.

If you can ignore all the bumps you can find a long swinging gesture along the entire torso and neck. This is the lifeline of this pose.

Come up with different shapes. Break it down rounder, and break it down more square.

![Steve huston torso master 2.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Steve%20huston%20torso%20master%202.png)

The head follows a boxy idea.

Masters often subtly manipulate the structure or gesture to convey an idea.

The rib cage tilts towards the picture plane. This tilts slowly transitions to a flat position down the torso.

There's a big gap between the tube idea and the final contours. We're adding a secondary form, in this case an egg, to mitigate it. Starting the drawing with a bulging egg would have lost the gestural idea.  
You can use a bullet shape, wedging the waist and the abdomen into the pelvis.

![Steve huston torso master 3.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Steve%20huston%20torso%20master%203.png)

With the lean of the rib quite extreme, we can use a chiseled form to capture the angles.

The alternating curves create a rhythm through the body. Contrapposto stems from this idea as well.

The bottom border of the hip can sit either at the crotch or the bottom of the glutes.

The shoulder can get very wide compared to the torso. The coke bottle shape obviates the connection better.

![Steve huston torso master 4.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Steve%20huston%20torso%20master%204.png)

Anatomy is merely the means, not the end. It should be subordinated to serve an aesthetic idea. The architecture and the simple shapes matter more. Group as much things together as possible.

If you can't use landmarks to connect two structures, relate the gestures to connect them.

### Demo - Torso

![Steve huston torso demo.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Steve%20huston%20torso%20demo.png)

Capturing the model's character can bring your art to the next level.

Find the 'almost vertical' lines and just make them vertical. Such angles are integral in balancing the figure.

From the back, the top of the rib cage will almost always tilt away into the body. Keep the width uniform for the waist-wide tube.

Sometimes you want to draw some of the final contours to feel out the idea.

Measure on the pinching side. The bean bag idea works for the torso, pinching and stretching organically. Using the armpit for measuring.

Draw big forms such as obliques as landmarks for structure. You don't need to know what the muscles represent; use them as materials for building architectures.

The construction lines should curve around the border, not bump into it.  
You can connect the two nipples to find their form. Hard-to-figure-out structures would be expressed as more boxy.

The belly button can stretch or compress and reinforce important ideas. Draw the little details that reinforces the big idea.

The hip bone can pop out in a stretching position and is an important corner to indicate.

### Master Analysis - Arms

![Pasted image 20250213131110.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250213131110.png)

Notice the alternating gestures along the body.

We get the shoulder inside the torso's silhouette. This hides the corner from showing, the corner being a major idea for the shoulder. If the arm lifts up, we can use the shoulder(from the back) and the arm as the corner instead.

As you add new structures, come back and feel out the rhythm. This can often obviate mistakes.

If the arm is down, draw a simplified collar bone, which also works as the top plane of the rib cage, then connect the arm to it. Either draw the egg shaped deltoid or draw the tubular arm.

Two gestures can form a corner, curves meeting at an angle.

The fingers and hand form a gesture that gracefully opposes the forearm. The forearm is a tapering tube, its ends straightening a bit to connect with the hand.

![Pasted image 20250213152155.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250213152155.png)

With the twist, treating the form as a pure profile then adding the rest is convenient.

The inverted triangle for the traps has often been used as a symbol of strength in western cultures. In the east, having a large weight on the hips used to symbolize strength.

The rib can be thought as two eggs, separated by its center line. This applies to the hip as well.

The shoulder blades are parallel to the spine in their neutral position. They are little triangles in perspective that sits on top of the rib cage. They work independently with the rib cage and connects the arm to the torso.

The pectoralis attaches at the armpit. It looks like a pinch, a dead end when the arm is down. When the arm is raised, you can see the pectoralis wrapping around the arm, following the deltoid.

![Pasted image 20250213185746.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250213185746.png)

The shoulder is inside the silhouette again. Make a corner with the collar bone or the scapula then attach the arm. The scapula creates chiseled corners that are also reflected in the shading.

As the arm moves forward it drags the scapula with it. As the arm articulates strongly away from the body the shoulder blade will be affected. Think of the shoulder and the shoulder blade as a single unit.

The chest attaches across the rib cage. The pec goes over the biceps, attaching below the deltoid. This connection is hidden by a pinch when the arm is lowered.  
The lats form a triangle, visible when the arm is raised.

Attach your next form along the outer corner, as it makes a cleaner connection.  
When the arm is flexed acutely, the elbow can be split into two corners to avoid pinching.

![Pasted image 20250213185814.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250213185814.png)

The shoulder unit forms a triangle. The muscles that move the arm around are all located in the upper torso.

Simple yet characteristic. Draw something that rings true in every levels.

The upper arm can be boxy, especially with muscular figures.  
The forearm can be thought as a flat box.  
The hand, ignoring the thumb, follows the gesture of the forearm.

The elbow is inside the contours, making the upper arm stiff.  
The egg idea from the baroque period can actually hinder the structural ideas, with forms pinching into each other.  
By adding corners to a jointed area we can form a tubular idea with better transition.

Gesture is defined by the longest sustained curve. By playing down the curves that oppose the gesture, you can create a gestural form even in a stiff angle.

### Demo - Arms

![Pasted image 20250213200443.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250213200443.png)

When the form leans flat on the viewing plane, choose either angle (does not matter) and push it slightly.

For the elbow prefer putting a bump as it can be smoothed out later. The corner helps with the proportions.

The arm can be thought as a drumstick, a thin form connecting into a bulbous form. This design is often seen in other parts of the body.

Draw out the elbow when you see them.  
Draw how the armpit folds, as it describes how the arm connects to the torso.

Find the longest sustained curve. You can separate a single shape into multiple, like a forearm being a box connected with an egg.  
The hands are simplified, lesser shapes that follows the arm.

Go back and revise your drawing as you add forms.

### Master Analysis - Legs

![legmaster1.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/legmaster1.png)

Where the tube of the torso interlocks into the hip is called the fulcrum. This is where the torso articulates from and is the origin of the legs.

The legs do not come out of the bottom of the hips, they start around the middle, higher than the pubic area. When the leg doesn't articulate there might not be a visible break out of the hip.

The first gesture ends around the knee. The longest sustained curve is almost always on the outside.  
Ignoring the calf muscles, you can find the curve of the tibia that follows the longest sustained curve.

![legmaster2.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/legmaster2.png)

From the side the hip is an egg or a horizontal barrel. The underside of the thigh should follow the gesture even with the fatty mass. You can see how its end takes a turn to follow the gesture.  
Start from the outside corner, and cut off minor bumps.

The stomach wedges into the hip like a bullet shape. When the legs bend acutely there should be two corners on the outside connection to represent the knee.

Find the wave action along the leg. Connect what you can't see with gestures.

Renaissance painters tend to group the entire leg together, but it is more accurate to separate them.  
An egg can be added to represent the calf.

![legmaster3.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/legmaster3.png)

The heels push out of the Achilles tendon, providing better leverage. Think of it as a box.  
The foot is a wedge with a visible arch on the big toe side. The big toe sticks out, while the other toes fade away.

The wedge of the foot creates a ski slope, which is sometimes overlapped by another subtle curve.

The bottom of the feet is better started with a squarer idea rather than a round one.  
The big toe separates out of the arch and has more movement. You can see the articulation as the foot collapses. It becomes a ribbon-like twist.

On the side, we see the 'karate-chop' side where the little toes attach to. The wedge sits on top.

### Demo - Legs

![legdemo.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/legdemo.png)

From the underside we get a transition from the meaty hip towards the skinny knee. This is the lesser line, don't make it too prominent.

It's possible to draw the shin inwards and then add the calf as a secondary form.

The foot is a wedge.

![legdemo2.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/legdemo2.png)

How far does the leg go? Check on the short side.

The leg bends at an acute angle, so we'll bump over the knee and create two corners.

Just like the wrist, the ankle joints create a slight bump. The ankle bones are good landmarks to draw.

### Demo - Full body

![Pasted image 20250311154416.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250311154416.png)

Simple yet characteristic. Simplest possible choice. Making the neck a bit more curved than it really is. With extra time we'll work on the connections.  
If the perspective is very shallow and flat, don't worry much about representing it.

Using squiggles as a shorthand for the knee. You don't always have to get the architectural truth, sometimes only the rhythmical truth is enough.

Little structures into a big structure, little gesture into a big gesture. Go back and refine the connectivity. Rendered details come last. You might want to re-draw different body parts multiple times.

Do as much structure as you need to feel confident about the next gesture.

Doing a small hook or wobble terminates a form.

Your drawing doesn't always have to be correct. You can convey motions and ideas that can ring true even if it's not accurate. Drawing can serve different purposes and can often surprise you.

![Pasted image 20250324183122.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250324183122.png)

You can choose different ideas for the structure, but the gestural truth must remain the same.

You can mix different methods as artistic devices. You can use contours effectively and mix it with constructive lay-ins. The corners are suggested.

![Pasted image 20250311154531.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250311154531.png)

Draw through the interruptions and overlaps to feel the complete idea. Curves and corners.  
You can always come back and re-state things multiple times. Stay light.

If you have more time, refine the connections. You can build on top of this some photo-realistic contours and rendering.

![Pasted image 20250324183859.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250324183859.png)

Every mark is reinforcing the gesture, structure, and the connections. Gesture is by far more important. As long as the gesture is correct things will ring true.

![Pasted image 20250328165011.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/retz%206wk/Pasted%20image%2020250328165011.png)

Don't think about the body parts that your forms represent. Think about the simple forms by themselves, cubes, tubes, etc. This gives you control over them.

Simple curves and straights. Add in landmarks and secondary forms where you feel necessary.  
The shoulder is a corner. Find the simplest possible statement, getting the spirit of the pose.

Get down simple shapes to replace the complex anatomy. Understand the process of that replacement. Choose an idea, a solution.

You don't have to do full figures. You may choose to focus on a single part of the body instead. Try drawing separately a body part you're interested in. The foot, the thumb, etc.
