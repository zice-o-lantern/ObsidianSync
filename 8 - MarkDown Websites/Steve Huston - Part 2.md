## Parts of the Body

### Before we start

We're getting the ideas down simply and moving along quickly. It will ring true on a very simplified level. Then we can get the composition and the relationships, on top of which we can lay in more complex drawings.

Any time you feel rushed, slow down. We're not learning to draw faster. Go slow, draw every mark that rings true.  
_What has to be there to ring true?_ This process leads to a finished drawing if you want, but it makes you prioritize the big things that must not be lost in the process.

When you look at great artists' paintings, think about what they leave out. We choose what is important and that builds style. We're learning to **prioritize**.

### Head, Neck, and Shoulder

![Pasted image 20250505201641.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%202%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250505201641.png)

Think of the head of the first structure and the first gesture. A figure's head and eyes are always the first read. If we try to attach a head to an existing body, it tends to look stuck and unnatural.

The gesture of the head would be its long axis, its center line. It sits where the forehead meets the nose, and where the lips meet the chin.

The head looks like an egg (or tube) from the front. Make sure to give enough mass to the skull. Heavier on the top, not the other way around.

![Pasted image 20250507115823.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%202%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250507115823.png)

From the side, a sailboat shape nicely suggests the protruding height of the skull.

The ear angles back a bit from that gesture line. The long axis of the skull goes back and slightly up as it moves from front to back.

The digastric plane steps back and flows into neck. It is important to draw it in order for the face to connect. The neck comes out from the underside of the chin.

The neck is a tube, which forms an hourglass shape from a profile. It is a transitional form and doesn't require much indication of its three-dimensional position. The neck can create a graceful opposing curves against the torso.

Make sure the back of the skull stays high compared to the placement of the chin.

#### Whistle Notch

![Pasted image 20250505202225.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%202%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250505202225.png)

Imagine cutting a notch out of a tube. That’s the whistle notch idea. This idea becomes the eye socket that houses the eyeball.

All features, except the ear, are on the front of the face. The whistle notch acts as the corner for the face.

If you use the eyebrow and the cheek line as it meets the lower eyelid, that’ll give you the notch. Following the eyebrow leads to where the cheekbone meets the lower lid, which moves down towards the lips.

![Pasted image 20250507115804.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%202%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250507115804.png)

#### Three-quarter view

![Pasted image 20250505202558.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%202%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250505202558.png)

The triangle construction also works for a three-quarter view.

The whistle notch has become the barest divot. Ears are good indicators of the head's position. See how it begins to crowd the front of the face.

![Pasted image 20250505202805.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%202%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250505202805.png)

Notice the curvature of the centerline. Measure how close it gets to the far side of the face.

Find a _T_ with the gesture and the **eyebrow line**. Mark off the features with construction lines ending with the chin. They are all parallel to each other.

Extending the **brow line towards the ear** gives you the lean of the head. Place the corner at the end or arch of the eyebrow.

The ear attaches to the sideburn area. The neck comes from behind the ear, both front and back views.

#### Back view

![Pasted image 20250505204400.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%202%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250505204400.png)

Since the cranium is an egg, from the back it is a ball. The face is wider than the neck, and it peeks out on the sides.

Add a simple construction line for the shoulders and the sagging triangle for the shrugging muscles. The trapezius goes all the way up to the skull and sits behind the neck, partly obscuring the head.

Get the head-neck-shoulder connection correct. Find how the head relates to the neck.

![Pasted image 20250507115734.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%202%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250507115734.png)

### Torso

 

The rib cage can be either a tube, egg, box or a combination of them. Have it touch the shoulder line.

The waist extends this form, connecting it to the hip. It is a transitional form and doesn't require constructed ends.

The hip can be a bulging box, a tipped over tube, or a miniskirt for females. The bottom border of the hip can sit either at the crotch or the bottom of the glutes. It is the root of the body so suggesting its structure is important.

Male tends to collect more mass at the waist. Female has less bulk at the waist, but more at the lower hips.

![Pasted image 20250505234806.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%202%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250505234806.png)

You can cut through the shoulders and visualize a coke bottle. This makes clear how the neck connects to the torso. The coke bottle idea connects the head to the rib cage in any kind of articulations. We're seeing through the interruptions and feeling the inner connectivity.

The stomach wedges into the hip like a bullet shape. This interlock is where the torso articulates from and is the origin of the legs.

Draw a waist-wide tube; keep its width uniform.

#### Side view

![Pasted image 20250505235126.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%202%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250505235126.png)

Ribs-to-neck connection in back sits very high, while it’s much lower in front.

The rib cage has a vertical section to it that corresponds to the placement of the shoulder blades. The stomach and lower back also have that verticality before the dynamic tilt of the hips kicks in. If these vertical moments aren’t shown the figures will look unbalanced.

The rib cage leans back when upright, therefore top of the tube will lean backwards. The belly goes straight on, and the hip leans forward. This creates an accordion-like design.

From the side the hip is an egg or a horizontal barrel.

![Pasted image 20250507115706.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%202%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250507115706.png)

Torso, more simplified, is a beanbag.

#### Back view

![Pasted image 20250505235831.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%202%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250505235831.png)

From the back, the beginning of the rib cage sits slightly higher than the shoulder line, and the 7th vertebrae, the end of the neck, sits higher.

The stomach, legs, and pubic area don’t block the hips as they do from the front. Also notice how the hips tip up and the ribs tip down to bind into the lower back. The constructed ends curve accordingly.

![Pasted image 20250507134853.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%202%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250507134853.png)

### Arms and hands

#### Upper arms

Arms are tubes, which are curved in most cases. They tend to be very fluid even in stiff positions due to their asymmetry.

![Pasted image 20250507105106.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%202%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250507105106.png)

The shoulder is a corner. To start the arms, always make that corner connection strong and round off later. Upper arm from the front/back can look straight and stiff, which you should try to avoid unless intended.

![Pasted image 20250507105641.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%202%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250507105641.png)

Add the shape of the shoulder muscle on top to create the gestural flow. The upper arm is a parallel tube from shoulder to elbow.

![Pasted image 20250507105949.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%202%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250507105949.png)

The shoulder blades are parallel to the spine in their neutral position. They are little triangles in perspective that sits on top of the rib cage. They work independently with the rib cage and connects the arm to the torso.

![Pasted image 20250507110051.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%202%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250507110051.png)

We get the shoulder inside the torso's silhouette. This hides the corner from showing. If the arm lifts up, we can use the shoulder(from the back) and the arm as the corner instead.

If the arm is down, draw a simplified collar bone, which also works as the top plane of the rib cage, then connect the arm to it. Either draw the egg shaped deltoid or draw the tubular arm.

![Pasted image 20250507110106.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%202%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250507110106.png)

As the arm moves forward it drags the scapula with it. As the arm articulates strongly away from the body the shoulder blade will be affected. Think of the shoulder and the shoulder blade as a single unit.

#### Lower arms and hands

![Pasted image 20250507111912.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%202%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250507111912.png)

![Pasted image 20250507111926.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%202%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250507111926.png)

The forearm is a tapering tube, its ends straightening a bit to connect with the hand. It always maintains a curve; it will swing outwards. You can have a tube with one side curving more than the other side, which will make a tapering tube. You can also oppose a straight with a curve.

The hand, ignoring the thumb, forms a gesture that gracefully opposes (or follows) the forearm.

![Pasted image 20250507111942.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%202%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250507111942.png)

#### Basic articulation & The elbow test

![Pasted image 20250507112134.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%202%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250507112134.png)

The only serious mistake you can make with curves is to make it curve in the wrong direction. The **elbow test** can help you figure out the curves direction; when the elbow is down, the curve of the arm will swing up. When the elbow is up, it will swing down. This applies in all positions as long as the elbow favors one side.

When the arm is flexed acutely, the elbow can be split into two corners to avoid pinching. For the elbow prefer putting a bump as it can be smoothed out later.

Draw how the armpit folds, as it describes how the arm connects to the torso.

Always complete the gesture/structure steps for the each part (upper arm) before beginning the next one (lower arm). Connect the next gesture is on the outside corner.

Find the longest sustained curve. You can separate a single shape into multiple, like a forearm being a box connected with an egg. The arm can be thought as a drumstick, a thin form connecting into a bulbous form. This design is often seen in other parts of the body.

### Legs and feet

#### Upper legs

![Pasted image 20250507133110.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%202%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250507133110.png)

For the legs, the outside corner is along the back, the underside of the hips.  
Connecting the legs too low is a common mistake. The thighs connect to the middle of the hips, higher than the pubic area, or even along the top when the legs are straight.

The thighs are tapering tubes, the insides more straight than the outside for the legs to be able to be brought together.

From profile, the line drops off from the top of the hip before curving into the thigh. It gives us more nuanced and convincing connection.

![Pasted image 20250507133409.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%202%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250507133409.png)

The difference between male and female is mainly in the hips, not the thighs.

The underside of the thigh should follow the gesture even with the fatty mass opposing it.

#### Lower legs

![Pasted image 20250507134256.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%202%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250507134256.png)

From the front or back, you can see the double-bump silhouette of standing legs. As long as you can see an ankle bone in the contours, the legs will almost always form a B shape. The little bumps in the insides line up in one subtle curve or a straight. The longest sustained curve is almost always on the outside.

From the sides, the front of the thigh is fuller and more curved. The calves bulge towards the back while the shin remains straight and thin. This forms an S curve.

An egg can be added to represent the calf.

When the legs bend acutely there should be two corners on the outside connection to represent the knee.

For now, group the knee area with either the upper or the lower leg, whichever seems more appropriate.

![Pasted image 20250507134321.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%202%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250507134321.png)

Structure can ring true expressed in different ways via _simple yet characteristic_. It will evolve over time and varies from person to person. We want to find solutions to what we’re seeing that are ever more characteristic to us.

Gesture is more important to get right. Gesture is the fundamental design line, and also a connecting line.

#### Feet

![Pasted image 20250507134715.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%202%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250507134715.png)

The foot is a simple sagging triangle from the profile angling briefly back at the heel and swinging forward to the toes. From the front, draw it as a simple tapering cone that cuts off at the toes. Add the toes grouped into a single shape.

The wedge of the foot creates a ski slope idea.

![Pasted image 20250507134829.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%202%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250507134829.png)

The back view has the heel and attaching tendon. It looks like a little chimneystack if you square the heel. The foot shape peeks from behind.

#### Articulating the legs

![Pasted image 20250507135943.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%202%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250507135943.png)

Find the simplest lay-in shapes you can. See how much you can distill it down. Then, take the simplest of the lay-ins and build it back up.

### Proportions of the Body

![Pasted image 20250505200851.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%202%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250505200851.png)

![Pasted image 20250507115918.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%202%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250507115918.png)

The number and character of the bones and muscles in both sexes are the same. The proportions and constructed forms of each simply vary a bit due to differing fat deposits and muscle masses.

The eyes are at the halfway point. The nose is the halfway between the eyes and the chin. Halfway between that is the lower edge of the lower lip. The ears sit between the nose and the brow line. In the profile, the ear sits around the middle.

We look for the shoulder line. The pit of the neck is a good starting point, its length usually a third of the head.  
The pit of the neck is lower than the 7th vertebrae. This creates a downward angle from the side. The back of the skull ends around the eye line where it connects to the neck.

The tube of the rib cage ends along the pit of the neck. The length of the head plus neck is equal to the length of the rib cage.  
Alternatively, going down one head from the chin aligns with the nipple line.  
Down another head is the belly button. Down another head gives you the bottom of the pubic area.

From the start of the leg to the bottom of the kneecap is two heads long. The leg starts from the middle of the hips, which aligns with the top of the pubic area.  
From the bottom of the knees, two heads down give the length of the calves and the feet.

The arm connects along the collar bone. The elbow aligns with the bottom of the rib cage. From the shoulder to the elbow is roughly the same length as the rib cage.  
The elbow to the knuckles is the same length as the upper arm. The hand ends around the middle of the thigh.

![Pasted image 20250324112339.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250324112339.png)

Give extra attention to how you begin and end a constructed part. Do a one shape that's truthful, do not skew or open it trying to fit it with another. Complete a truthful gesture and structure before moving on to the next gesture and structure.

Perspective is most shown where the ends meet the sides. It is very important to properly wrap the contour lines around without pinching. Your drawing won't be convincing if you do not imply the other side somewhere. When you draw the front, you feel the back.

The law of ellipses, the longest axis of the ellipse will always be in the right angle with the cylinder's axis. This law applies regardless of the perspective.
