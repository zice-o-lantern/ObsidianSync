### Master analysis

#### Michelangelo

The forearm is expressed as an egg. The parallels in the head suggest a boxy construction. The left arm is left less finished and you can see how the arm is defined with simple contours.

#### Raphael

See how close the ear is to the face. Giving the ear a back edge suggests structure better. See how the features wrap around and the bandana reinforces the position of the head.

A curve should rather not be uniform and symmetrical. Think about its apex, faster and slower through the curve. The apex can be thought of as a corner, and can be expressed with broken straights too.

#### Carracci

The form is very bubbly, reminiscent of Baroque artists. You can still get the sense of a gesture via the connections between.

The drapery follows the major gestures. The center of gravity sits between the legs, forming a triangle.

The torso tilts away, suggesting the form towering over the viewer. The masses also overlap in a way that reinforces this idea.

Muscles attach across the bones, not onto the joint. This overshoot suggests a directionality that can be used effectively(and selectively).

#### Pontormo

You can feel the corner of the tube overlapping with the waist. You can work with a simplified outlines and impose the structure on top.

Search out your proportion as you draw. Wing it instead of measuring.

Work with a risk and push things further. Don't stick to a process that gives you a B+ every time.

The twist is expressed with an S curve. Alternatively, draw out the form as a perfect profile, then add the extra mass onto it.

### Demo 1

Goal: break down parts of a body into a simple yet characteristic shape. Draw the idea of a head, not the head itself.

![Steve huston demo 1 1.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Steve%20huston%20demo%201%201.png)

Compare angles with a horizontal and vertical line. Ghost over lines multiple times, using them to search for relationships between. You can draw over more crisp lines later.

However complex the subject is, reduce it to its simplest essence. Come up with evermore simple shapes, evermore personal shapes.

Use the negative shapes between pinching forms to find proportions. As you add more marks, see how it relates to existing forms. Nothing is correct on its own; they are correct in a context of relationships.

Once you draw something that you're comfortable/confident with, you can use it as measuring unit.

Err to the more dynamic. It's better to make the pinching side too short than make it too long.

For the head, draw the sailboat and optionally add corners to suggest position. (note: this is explained later)

Use zig-zags as a shorthand for pinching. Find enough structure in one form to feel confident in finding the connecting gesture.

Difficult forms can be expressed as more boxy, chiseled with straights.

### Demo 2

![Steve huston demo 2 1.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Steve%20huston%20demo%202%201.png)

Find the center line, the distance between the center and the shorter side, and the eyebrow line.

Don't hurry, even for a timed sketch. The process always stays the same.

Draw placeholders for each feature. Draw the underside of the chin (digastric plane).

![Steve huston demo 2 2.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Steve%20huston%20demo%202%202.png)

Think of a box, even when you're not drawing it explicitly. The position of the ear suggests the tilt of the head.

If you can't get something right, draw it over to the side. If you still can't get it, draw another part first.

Go for a simpler idea. Don't be distracted by all those beautiful forms.

### Demo 3

![Pasted image 20250425212833.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250425212833.png)

Simple yet characteristic, and the long axis. Draw the simplest possible shape.

We're looking for eggs, boxes, and tubes. Don't worry about getting everything right. You can always come back and fix them.

Find the natural corners of the body, like the hip bone. You can use different shapes to express the same thing; it's a stylistic choice.

We find more and more character to the structure as we need to find the relationship between the parts. _The shoulder line is above the eyebrow line._

Draw simple everyday objects as an easier exercise.
