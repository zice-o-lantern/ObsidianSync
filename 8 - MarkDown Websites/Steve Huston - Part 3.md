## Laws of Light

### Before we start

Every art form works in a binary logic of _the separate parts in relationship to the whole_. This logic relates to our core human experience; our individuality in relation to the world, and our yearning for connection.

We need to find the balance between individual characters and the complete whole. We need to draw interesting details without breaking the gestural idea.

___

When creating art, we're not creating actual 3D objects, just the illusion of three-dimensionality. The idea is not real, but it mirrors the relationships that reality has. Therefore, we can always make up things for convenience.

Metaphors are useful since we can use ideas that we understand to grasp what we don't fully understand. For example, "_God is a rock._" Art, on a poetic level, works with metaphors and symbols.  
Rembrandt's light was a metaphor of salvation; the beauty was in the enlightenment of the form, not the form itself.

### Different value = different plane

![Pasted image 20250513112057.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%203%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250513112057.png)

Value creates the illusion of form and depth. Our lay-ins give us the idea of depth; value gives us the feeling of depth. **Every time we see different value, we perceive a different plane.**

### A two-value system

![Pasted image 20250513113039.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%203%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250513113039.png)

We always start big and simple, followed by small and complex.

We want to show what is in the light and what is in the shadow. We also need to establish the relationship between foreground and background. These are the two primary contrasts we need to address.

![Pasted image 20250513113211.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%203%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250513113211.png)

To find the _shape of the form_, we first need to establish **two opposing sides**. Human body has clearly defined width for each body parts, but not so much on their long axis. By finding the two sides of a form, we can build it and blend different parts together.

We'll find the shape of the shadow and give it a darker value. The exact value depends on various factors, but it must be substantially darker than the light side. When you squint your eyes, you should clearly see **two distinct values**.

### Starting the ball

![Pasted image 20250401101912.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250401101912.png)

Identify the beginning of the shadow (_form shadow_) and the end of the shadow (_cast shadow_). A form shadow will spill onto different forms and cast shadows onto them.

Form shadows are usually softer, transitioning gradually from light to shadow. Cast shadows, in contrast, present a binary concept (in shadow or not) and have a sharper edge.

### Box logic

![Pasted image 20250513113432.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%203%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250513113432.png)

Different value = different plane, turns the form. We can use the same logic for every form, even round ones, and the contours suggest the rest.

The beginning of the shadow is a **corner**. It gives us structure. If the form is squarer, we'll have little to no gradation. If it's round, it will have more gradation.

### Halftones, highlights, and a new rule

The light side can have highlights, with the rest being halftones. Halftones can range from almost as dark as the shadow to almost as light as the highlight.

#### Halftones

![Pasted image 20250513114025.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%203%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250513114025.png)

To blend, smudge across the border of the shadow.

The two initial values (light and shadow) are what give us the illusion of form; breaking them is a bad mistake. As we darken the halftones and lighten the shadow side, we can actually weaken the initial idea.

When we squint, we should still perceive two separate values, despite all the rendering details.

#### Highlights

![Pasted image 20250513114256.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%203%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250513114256.png)

Highlights are light that reflects directly into the eye. They relate to the viewer's position; moving around will move the highlight. They tend to stay in the area most directly facing the light source.

#### Bouncing light

![Pasted image 20250513114522.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%203%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250513114522.png)

**Everything that receives light becomes a source of light itself.** The light that bounces up off the step will lighten the planes that face down.

This concept, as opposed to _direct light_, is called _bounced light_. Bounced light gradates in value, just like direct light.

### Ball continued

![Pasted image 20250401103820.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250401103820.png)

Instead of adding light to the shadow, we'll add more darkness. This is the **core shadow**, where the least amount of bounced light hits. As we render by adding darkness, we're reinforcing the fundamental concept. It creates a sense of bouncing light without muddling the two value relationship.

In the light side, we'll add more light, going progressively lighter on the halftones.

_If we want to make something appear bright, we can either make it brighter or put something dark against it. If we want something to appear rounder, we can make it rounder or put something square against it. If we want more details, oppose them with simplicity._

### Finishing the ball

![Pasted image 20250401104317.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250401104317.png)

Notice how we're losing the edge between the shadow and the background. This is a good thing, as it prevents the ball from feeling alien from its environment. We're effectively breaking the silhouette.

Light can fall off and create additional gradation. Highlights and halftones can gradate down to show it’s fading out of light. They can also gradate across a flat plane such as a tabletop to move the eye in and out of space a little more naturally.

We can move around our highlights, move tones around, and just **lie** about how light works. As long as we maintain consistency within the rules of our created world, the audience will buy it. Art is a make-believe.

### Highlights continued

![Pasted image 20250513120309.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%203%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250513120309.png)

Overusing highlights, or putting highlights incorrectly, is worse than having no highlights at all. Well placed highlights can reinforce the structure and strengthen the contrast.

We do not want to place highlights close to the core shadow; it will make the form look sharp and does not give any information.

You can put highlights right against cast shadows to accentuate the interrupted light in a cool way. This still does not give any new information though.

![Pasted image 20250513120209.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%203%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250513120209.png)

Highlight, just like shadow, is a corner. We want to put it between the shadow and the outer border. With the two corners suggested the planes split up and suggest a more rounded form.

Highlights are also gestural, in that they follow the long axis. They can curve and zig-zag.

## Rendering Strategies

### Before we start

Art is an idea. When we render, we need to make every mark count. Every mark we make should be either a gestural mark or a structural mark.

As we render and add secondary forms we inevitably weaken the gestural idea. As we are visual philosophers, we need a strategy to make every mark reinforce the gestural and structural idea.

### Rendering Strategies

Structure, is the movement over form.

![Pasted image 20250408104532.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250408104532.png)

**Contour**  
It might be the contours made by the costume, like the sleeves or a watch. It might be the pinching flesh, forms binding together. It might be the cast or form shadow, as they track over the form. These are the movement over form in the literal sense.

**Overlap**  
_This in front of this. We'll feel the movement over form just by how it breaks over._ A ball can only overlap, it cannot interlock.

**Interlock**  
_Better yet, it could be an interlock._ Interlock is where one form inserts into the other. This is best shown in the drumstick idea. Unlike an overlap, interlock shows both the ends and the sides. It is very useful for showing the perspective.

Interlock reflects how the body works, since muscles attach across the joint and insert into and out of each other.

**Axis**  
If we add nipples and breasts onto the tube of the torso, and represent them as ellipses, their axis will follow the torso's perspective.

**Anatomy**  
_And we can have the anatomy. In a way, it's just this(interlock). But the anatomy can reinforce it._

**Closure**  
Our natural tendency to _connect the dots_ can be used to our advantage.

Any line or shape is a visual arrow. This movement needs to either point over to the other side, or point down to the next form. _Movement over the form(structure), or between the forms(gesture)._

Closure, is the idea that any elements we draw will visually connect and create a movement.

The nipples, the outside of the chest, the connection on the breastbone, and the ribs, can all connect into a single movement that moves over the form.

**When we're under a form, the details on the sides should consistently be lower than the ones on the middle.**

![Pasted image 20250408103403.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250408103403.png)

By using these strategies we can make the audience feel the volume and structure using detailed, rendered information.

Some of the times the anatomy will hurt the perspective instead of reinforcing it. Like how the deltoid does when the arm is going away from us.

You have to sort those out. We want to highlight the information that reinforces and edit out one that hurts.

Just like line, tone is also a visual arrow. Gradation can move us over the form.
