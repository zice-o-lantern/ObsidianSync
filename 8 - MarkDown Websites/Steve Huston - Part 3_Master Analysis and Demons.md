### Master Analysis 1

![Pasted image 20250402150852.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250402150852.png)

Notice the symmetry and the asymmetry. _What is over here, is over there._ But we can also find asymmetry in the features.

Symmetry is healthy and aesthetically pleasing, but also boring. Asymmetry in the position or lighting helps bring out the character.

The head is dealt with with a capsule shape, which tracks nicely with the center line. The clothing is simplified into a few planes.

On the face the big contrast is expressed with tones, and the small details are drawn with lines.

![Pasted image 20250402151501.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250402151501.png)

Even though this drawing is mainly atelier-style(outline focused), you can see the conception of structure on the body. The torso is a boxy shape, and the details track along the planes.

The tones are drawn in a way that does not break the big planar relationships established by the outlines.

The arm forms a dramatic curve, reinforced by the border of the shadow.

![Pasted image 20250402152724.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250402152724.png)

Criticize the masters. What would you have done differently? This will make you have a unique voice, not just a lesser copy of a master.

Sketches allow us to see the thinking process. This was an ideation sketch; having dramatic, clear shadows would not have been necessary.

![Pasted image 20250402153433.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250402153433.png)

The darks do not have much details; the silhouette does most of the work. You really don't need much work to suggest the forms.

This sketch is drawn in a 3-value system: light, shadow, and one more for separating the foreground.

As you work, look at the silhouette. _What work can I do, gesturally and structurally, just with the shape of the shadow?_

![Pasted image 20250402154340.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250402154340.png)

Try adding a gradation, a transition from light to dark. Indoor lights tend to fall off. This creates a sense of movement with tones.

You can also see how Sargent starts light, and gradually adds more dark.

### Demonstration 1

We'll use the same process. A simple lay-in, and add shadows in there.

![Pasted image 20250402161311.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250402161311.png)

The leg is a tube, so it will have tubular shadows. Regardless of the form, shadow is a corner. We'll draw the two sides of the form and find the shadow shape. The order does not matter much.

We'll wobble down into the knee. We don't have to explain the little structures, the little wobbles, and they make the drawing look more sophisticated than it really is.

Shadows are also gesture lines, they will integrate into the next structure. _The thigh into the knee, the knee into the calf._

___

Shape of the form, the shape of the shadow. The border of the shadow should remain strong and not leak. When the forms fight against each other you see a bump, a zig-zag. When they cohere you see a wobble.

You can find the buttocks casting a shadow. Since we can't find the other corner of the butt, we'll go all the way to the hip and find the two sides there. The shadow, again, is a corner.

As you draw one side, feel the opposing side. The connectivity, rhythm, relationship.

You see a drumstick form, meaty mass thinning out on the jointed area.

![Pasted image 20250402174953.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250402174953.png)

The shoulder, in any position, is a corner for the arm. The torso shows an accordion action.

The shadow shape is very simple and thin, but we still don't want to draw it fuzzily. We can let the tones bleed out and re-define the forms with lines. We can keep changing things this way.

![Pasted image 20250402174725.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250402174725.png)

However detailed you plan to get, start with simple ideas. The shoulder is conceived as a boxy form, and the shadow and highlight will follow those corners.

Draw the hand like a mitten and break apart the fingers later.

![Pasted image 20250402174238.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250402174238.png)

Look for where things are going to connect them properly. The shoulder muscles connect into the armpit. The shoulder blade is like a triangle that sits on top of the rib cage.

We ghost over multiple lines so that the audience can choose what they like the most.

We find a zig-zag on the upper arm, and a clear corner on the elbow. The arm folds, making the mass bunch up and wrap around.

Difficult forms, chisel them out. Make sure they're still gestural. You can mix different styles and techniques as long as the core ideas remain.

### Demonstration 2

Laws of light and how value and lines work together. This time the paper is toned to match the middle value of the skin.

![Pasted image 20250403000011.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250403000011.png)

Start with a simple tube, a simple bean bag. If we conceive the rib cage as an egg, the shadow shape will follow that idea too.

A good way to see if your form is simple yet characteristic, is to see if the shadow shape from the reference follows the constructed idea you've drawn. This time it does, so we'll draw it as such.

We look past the details to find the most fundamental idea. We draw each side of the form, draw the shadow's border, and fill in the value.

The arm's tube goes into the egg shape of the shoulder. The egg of the rib goes into the tube of the waist. Since the forms transition into another we leave the shadow shape open and connect onto it.

The arm casts a shadow over the egg. The downward planes of the shoulder blade catches some shadow.

On the waist and the hip we see multiple egg shapes interlocking together. This would be the simplest possible statement.

Wobbling the shadow shape suggests a more sophisticated idea. We get a little bit of halftones by smudging the shadows.

___

![Pasted image 20250403003304.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250403003304.png)

Make sure you do a lay-in that you can take to the finish. We need a process that is open-ended and useful on all levels. _Simple, yet characteristic_ is the key.

We wanna slow down, in order not to auto-pilot. _Do you have your mindset in mind?_ You want to make your mark serve your ideas and your purpose.

Carefully feel out the jointed connections, how they fit. We also want to feel the proportions and the rhythms.

We're now finding the inner rhythms, the inner connectivity. Feel the connections all the across, all the way down. Drawing life is about finding the relationships.

Put down tones and blend it to create halftones. The direction in which you blend should reinforce the rhythm.

![Pasted image 20250403003245.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250403003245.png)

_We're picking out how I move from here, to here. I think of it like a stream; the water will flow down and stream around a rock, maybe loop around a fallen log. But it's always moving towards its destination. How do we get from a jaw to the shrugging muscle? How do we get from head to toe? How do integrate this to that?_

-   Lay-in things carefully with just enough detail. Look for where things end, in order to begin the next thing.
-   Pay attention to how forms evolve, _from an egg, to a box._
-   Describe how things come together, like the armpit.
-   Always be thinking about the other side, and the opposing gesture. _Swing, swing, swing._
-   Think of the biggest, and the smallest rhythms on through.
-   We're juggling a lot of information, and we want to go slow to be in control of them.
-   We can always change our mind and re-state things.

### Demonstration 3

![Pasted image 20250408113302.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250408113302.png)

Lay-in. The construction lines tell us what needs to happen. Any time we have overlaps, they have to reinforce the perspective. They can be big and small.

Any time we have the sides _and_ the ends overlap, we have an interlock. That's the drumstick idea, narrow form inserting into a thicker form.

The axes of the shoulder blades drop down, following the perspective.

The pinching of the rib cage against the obliques are natural contour lines that follow the structure.

![Pasted image 20250408113840.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250408113840.png)

The two sides of the triceps and its tendinous connection form a closure. Something near the sides, and something near the center, you'll make the connection across.

The overlapping obliques, the sacral area, and the tail bone also form a closure. It forms a way deeper perspective but that is okay. The tones can help track and reinforce the connection.

Now we light the form.

![Pasted image 20250408182303.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250408182303.png)

We want to know the two sides of the form. The shadow shape is a corner, where the form turns. We leave it open ended to leave room for later connections.

By reinforcing the corner, the core shadow, we reinforce the structure while also suggesting secondary light.

Take a section, work across, and go down. This makes sure each form fits and flows and works together.

When the forms fight against each other, or go from convex to concave, they show more individual character. We'll see a zig-zag action.

We can get the big forms and let the little forms take care of themselves. A little wobble is enough as long as it's tracking well with the big rib cage.

We want to think like a conductor, _this to this_. The parts into the greater whole.

By rendering along the long axis we're letting the gradation take care of the form. We're also _rendering the gesture_, moving along the gestural edge. Every mark is a visual arrow that should flow in the right manner.

_I'm in the flow on this, where everything is working for me consciously and unconsciously. My process, my techniques, are all serving each other; I'm not fighting it. That's gonna make life way easier. And you're going to end up with happy accidents, like this. Where the audiences will go, "That's amazing that you were able to do that. I can't believe you understood those form."_

_Likewise, you can just wing it, and say, 'Well my composition needs something here'. I don't know what the heck that is in terms of muscle, but it's going to track over my rounded form in my tilted perspective and move down my fluid gesture. It's going to feel right._

On the sacrum we get an extra-special interlock, a tailed insertion. The further you can take those structures, the more convincing they will be.

_Everything is moving over the form, or between the forms. Even these little pinches._ The techniques, the hatchings, the paint strokes, too.

![Pasted image 20250408124543.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250408124543.png)

We're losing the gesture, a single beautiful curve broken by the outlines. We'll combat this.

We can use the 'Ingres' method, and play down the bumps. We quiet them. This works, but we also lose some of the drama.

So instead, using closure, we connect elements together to re-state the long gesture. The pinch of the neck, the bump at the shoulder blade, the fiber of the glutes, and the core shadow on the leg, all connect to a single curve. _Through closure, something even better._

Now we have a kinetic idea, one we can play with. _Finding the rhythm, the connectivity. Look at the work halftone does for us. It keeps the gesture alive, makes the connectivity across the form._

_Notice now the wild rides. We have an almost infinite way of moving, interlacing, aligning, through closure. Every fibers of the deltoid can now be a new rhythm._

![Pasted image 20250408143932.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250408143932.png)

_If I go down the long axis of the nose with the highlight or the core shadow, I've described where the sides meet the front. I've described structure. If I go down the cheek I'll go down the longest possible axis and for any form I'm drawing, always down the long axis. As I show you the structural planes moving from beginning to end of the form, I am also showing the gesture flowing down from one idea to the next. So those long axis strokes are by far the most efficient, helpful, and descriptive marks we can make. Most of our realist painters, who know their drawing skills, will do that._

### Master Analysis 2

![Pasted image 20250409143644.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250409143644.png)

As tricky as this pose is, it can be simplified into a series of eggs that interlocks.

The form is lighted as such, except for the zig-zag on the rib cage. This means the forms are fighting each other, two balls pushing together. This follows the truthful form of the rib cage.

Shadows should group together when you squint at it. They should separate from the light side.

![Pasted image 20250409144739.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250409144739.png)

The rib cage is an egg, evident on the bulging contours. The border of the shadow is hard to see, but the egg conception makes it easy to imagine it.

There's a bump on the pelvis; and we have no idea what it is. Get the big thing right, and the weird details will add up.

![Pasted image 20250409150639.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250409150639.png)

The chest is now a boxy idea, and the shadow shape follows the corner. The pecs are like a wedge.

The belly is a ball, most of which is in shadows. We see a little zig-zag where the waist pinches against the rib. The box of the rib casts shadow onto it as well.

If you draw a simple shape, and the shadow shapes don't track well, you should have drawn a different shape.

The shoulder-shoulder blade unit shows behind the egg of the rib cage.

![Pasted image 20250409152833.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250409152833.png)

Draw through interruptions to feel the connection. The neck connects to the rib and then the shoulder sits on top.

We see a series of rounded forms forming multiple bumps. Let's simplify; the arm is casting shadow onto the back muscles, and the egg of the rib faces away from light. We have a small tube underneath that catches some shadow.

We can add more bumps to the shape without having to explain it. With the big things explained you can leave the small things unaddressed.

The arm and the triceps are an egg that bumps on the boxy elbow. A bump on the contours means that there are two forms fighting, and we see the deltoid as a wedge-like shape.

We can treat darker halftones as shadows. Dark halftones, if angled slightly more, would just be shadows.

When in doubt, simplify. Analyze what's happening.

### Demonstration 4

_I'm skipping demo 4, it's mostly him repeating what he's been teaching all along. It's interesting to watch him take a lay-in to a finished drawing, though, so definitely give it a watch._
