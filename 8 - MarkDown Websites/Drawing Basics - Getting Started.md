# Drawing Basics - Getting Started

> ## Excerpt
> If you can write the alphabet, you have enough hand-eye coordination to draw anything. Training your eyes and hands comes down to repetition and practice. Love the process, not just the end result.

Simplifying is harder than copying because it requires problem-solving. Learning to simplify what you see will help you communicate visual ideas more effectively.

### Project: Simplify from Observation

Imagine your subject as if it’s sculpted out of planes. Start with the contour and draw the edge between light and shadow. Simplify the values into five: two for shadow, and three for halftones and highlights. Use only hard edges.

#### Pear

Begin with light lines. Straight angles are easier to judge than complex curves. Imagine a line along the plane and break it where angle differences are significant.  
_Where are the best places to put the corners to express this curve?_  
_Where does this line start?_ Compare it to the opposite side. Compare angles with one another.

Give more weight to either the light or shadow; avoid dividing them equally in half.

#### Portrait

Plan your values ahead with a quick thumbnail. Since you can’t express everything with just five values, you must decide what to omit.

Mark the upper and lower bounds of your subject first. To check if the face is too long or wide, measure the length against the width. Start with contours, then find the borders of the shadow shapes. Flip the image upside down to observe the shapes as they are.

Reflected lights can make shadows appear like midtones, and dark midtones can look like shadows. To avoid making these mistakes, squint to group values together.

Step away for a minute, then return to refresh your eyes. Look for mistakes and correct them. Mistakes are inevitable—they’re part of the process. Draw angles between elements to identify misplacements and adjust proportions. Take your time; it takes hours just to lay out the sketch.

Think of your drawing as a sculpture, following the form with your strokes. Place hair details strategically using small, simple shapes. Leaving lighter tones around the edges creates the illusion of feathering.

In a finished drawing, you won’t paint every detail. Simplify areas of lesser interest to make the drawing feel more human and engaging. In areas of greatest interest, like the eyes, put extra effort into details. This contrast will make the entire drawing feel more polished.
