## Gesture and Structure

### Demystifying Gesture and Structure

![Pasted image 20250425204509.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%201%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250425204509.png)

Art is an idea about the world. The craft of drawing the human body succeeds through only two ideas: **gesture and structure**. These two ideas work for the biggest parts of your drawing, and for the smallest.

1.  Structure - the parts and the pieces
2.  Gesture - the connection between the parts

Structure is the distinct three-dimensional parts of any particular object. Structure in the human body is defined as the jointed parts. Ribcage, upper arm, etc.

Gesture is how we relate the parts and the pieces to each other. This concept of relating things to each other also applies to painting, with colors and values. In fact, all mediums of art are about **the parts, and the relationship between the parts**.

The process of art has to be a simple, intuitive, and fluid movement through different steps. At any time you should be able to go back to a previous step and take back control.

### Structure, simple yet characteristic

![Pasted image 20250425203813.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%201%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250425203813.png)

Starting with a simple shape, we can draw anything in the world. A ball, a tube, and a box. We can stylize into one of these shapes, or mix them. Just as with balls and eggs, you can draw tubes and boxes without ever drawing a straight line. This becomes important later.

Structure, the idea of dimensionality, is the **movement over form**. Outlines do not convey structure effectively as they move around the form, not over them. Structure lies on the contour lines, or construction lines.

Another way to think of it is that every mark we make should act as a **visual arrow**. The more conscious we are of where the arrows point, the more successful our drawings will be in terms of structure.

The strategy when beginning a construction is to draw a simple shape and turn it into a form by drawing the movement over it. The point is to get the idea onto the paper as simply and easily as possible. This will become our roadmap for rendering.

![Pasted image 20250425204103.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%201%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250425204103.png)

We're thinking about the idea, not the subject. We're not drawing a literal torso, we're drawing the _idea_ of a torso. Instead of trying to draw the subject, we're drawing the simplified idea of their form.

When we come up with an idea, we want it to be **simple**. It allows us to be quicker, to design, and to animate. Simple allows us to construct anything with the same methods and principles.

The idea has to be **characteristic** too, however. It has to represent the subject enough for us to see the idea. It should allow us to find the connections in between. If the idea too characteristic, however, you'll lose the simplicity.

This process of finding the _simple yet characteristic_ is a continuous learning curve that will happen throughout one's career. It is easy to start but hard to master.

### Gesture, the relationship between the parts

![Pasted image 20250425204616.png|500](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%201%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250425204616.png)

Gesture is the fundamental design line. It is also the **connecting line**.

Gesture can be thought of in two parts: each part must have a gesture itself. Each part must also have a gesture connecting to the whole.

Gesture is much more difficult and more important than structure. Getting the structure a bit off is okay as long as the gesture is truthful, but the opposite is not true. Every part of the body must have a truthful gesture in order to ring true.

Gesture is the **long axis curve of any structure**. Gesture is associated with anything that is alive. Anything alive is made with water, so it must be fluid, watery, graceful, and **curved**. Asymmetrical objects are always curved. Symmetrical objects in asymmetrical positions are also curved.

**Err to the more dynamic**. Caravaggio always made his shadows too dark, Rembrandt always made his light drop off too much, and Michelangelo made his figures too heroic.  
Push your ideas and curves more dynamically. You want a film that's too scary, not one that's not scary enough.

Gestures are **curves**. Structures are **corners**. Curves and corners. These will be the cornerstone ideas moving forward.

### The Pencil Test, understanding perspective

![Pasted image 20250425204854.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%201%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250425204854.png)

Let's now define structure as **form and position**. A form can lean, face, and tilt. The more corners a form has the easier it is to convey its position. **The more corners we add the more structure we see.**

Position = perspective. In order to find the perspective, we need to know the position of the form, as well as **our position** in relation to it.

![Pasted image 20250425204945.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%201%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250425204945.png)

**The pencil test** helps us figure out if a subject is facing towards or away from us. We can match up our pencil in the same position as the subject and observe the contour lines of the pencil.

You can use your pencil to judge the lean as well and bring the pencil directly to the canvas. Use the center line for judging the lean.

The problem with curves is that it constantly changes direction. For proper measuring of leaning, break up the curve into increments. Compare angles to horizontals and verticals.

### Tilting and Facing, balancing 2D and 3D

![Pasted image 20250425205200.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%201%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250425205200.png)

As we progress towards later steps, it's easy to stiffen up our figure, biasing it towards less fluidity. To fight this tendency it's important to judge facing (left and right rotation) well.

**Measure the shorter side** from the center line, then measure and add the longer side. Measuring on the short, pinching side is a good strategy for judging proportions as well.

Start from an internal idea and build out from there. When drawing the torso, instead of looking at the shoulder, draw a waist-wide tube then add the shoulder on top.

Tilting breaks the picture plane. This conveys the idea of three-dimensionality, which we have to translate into a 2D image.

It is important to think of the idea, not to copy. This is why lay-ins are important, since it establishes ideas that can later be reinforced by rendering.

We don't need to consider vanishing points much when it comes to figures, make parallel lines parallel. Be consistent with parallels or you will skew the form.

### Form + Position = Structure

![Pasted image 20250425205021.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%201%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250425205021.png)

Think about your eye level. If something is under your eye level, you will see its top. If something is over your eye level, you will see its bottom. As the object tilts towards / away from you the degree of the ellipses will change too.

Again, err towards more dynamic. Making things taper suggests even more depth.

Sometimes the form can sit at eye level, and we may not see either the top or the bottom. Try to avoid drawing anything flat; push it in either direction instead.

### Balancing Gesture and Structure

![Pasted image 20250312161456.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250312161456.png)

Most of your body parts are long in length. Form should flow into one another and not look like blobs. Gesture is a connecting, grouping, relating idea. The job of the artist is to cohere, to make sense of the noisy world.

Tubes, in a way, are three-dimensional gesture lines. They are curves that sit in a space. When we impose a structure onto a gesture the gesture tends to get hidden by the form. But if we can start with a **structure reinforcing the gesture**, the form will remain gestural.

Here's an example. Almost all the time the upper arm can be simplified into a tube, and the major muscle can be added as eggs. We wouldn't need a box for the arm, since the relationship between the upper arm and the forearm are enough to suggest the leaning position.

Also, using a box comes with the challenge of putting the anterior corner correctly. Therefore a tube with a center line is preferable. A box can then be added on top to suggest more corners.

When two curves oppose each other they cancel out. Avoid opposing curves that take up most or all the length of your jointed part. In that sense, an egg is less gestural than a tube.

![Pasted image 20250425210748.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250425210748.png)

Pursue the gesture in all steps of drawing, or else you'll lose them. Gesture is the connecting idea, a line that connects elements. Gesture has to make contact with something to be useful.

Look past the surface details and draw the narrowest part of the form (elbow, acromion process, knee, waist) then add the mass following the gesture. Think of a wave on a surface. Make the bumps and lumps hit the initial gesture curve and you will keep the gesture.

_For each curved design, there is a bulging side and a binding side, or rather, one side is convex and the other is concave. I’m defining our gesture as the bulging (convex) side._

For example, the legs and arms have different inner and outer contours. Look for the **longest sustained curve**. The lateral thigh, the frontal shin(ski slope idea), are all examples of the longest sustained curve.

### Gesture and Structure - Advanced

![Pasted image 20250425210251.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250425210251.png)

From the biggest to smallest, gesture and structure all the way. How does gesture relate to concepts like stretch, pinch, and twist?

When one side stretches, the other side pinches. The stretch side is simple and convex, while the pinching side is complex and concave.  
More importantly, the stretch side represents the gesture as it is the long axis curve. The pinching side has movement over the form and therefore fulfills the structural idea.

Start with the stretching side and as you add the structure the pinching will take care of itself.

![Pasted image 20250425210000.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%201%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250425210000.png)

A twist is always an S-curve. On the torso, you find it through the centerline. Twisting can also be thought of as **two opposing stretches**, or two bulges on opposing sides. Twisting does not have to break the tubular shape.

![Pasted image 20250425210501.png|300](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/Pasted%20image%2020250425210501.png)

For each jointed part, we can find a bulging curve. We give only one for each to avoid a rubbery look.  
We want a balance of curves and corners. If your figure looks stiff, make sure each jointed parts have a curved gesture. If it lacks structure, find more corners.

Find hard, square corners then connect them with curves. Corners can be rounded off later. This process is a back-and-forth balancing act.

Get enough structure so that you can find the next gesture with confidence. You might need quite a complex structure to be comfortable enough to find the next gesture.

![Pasted image 20250425205520.png](https://remarkable-haupia-580a77.netlify.app/img/user/3%20literature%20notes/attachments/steve%20huston/steve%20huston%20part%201%20book/Pasted%20image%2020250425205520.png)

_Gesture 1 (G1) is high and to the left. G2 is lower and to the right. G3 is lower still and to the left again, and so on all the way down._

The alternating peaks of the gesture create a wave-like design. This watery quality represents life, anything that moves.

Any set of forms with an asymmetrical design or in a dynamic pose is a balancing act. When all the forms within that set have a long axis curve as the basis of their design, the balancing act becomes a wave design.

The wave design provides enough balance and enable powerful action via compression. The wave can compress into a zig-zag design, representing the potential energy the figure holds.  
Zig-zag represents tension and can also be found in skin folds and creases.

All anatomy is, is the little structures that form little gestures. For each of these little gestures you need to feel the opposing gesture for the wavy design.
