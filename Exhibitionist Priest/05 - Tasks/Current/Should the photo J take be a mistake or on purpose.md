<span style="color:rgb(76, 58, 166)">Im still trying to determine on that</span>

<span style="color:rgb(232, 17, 93)"> I think on purpose fits the narrative better than by mistake. I think if anything, Isaac should lie about it being a mistake at most. </span>

<span style="color:rgb(76, 58, 166)">I see more being on purpose and pretending to be a mistake because i thought it was hot that you know, we give a chance to Cesare and Isaac to go their own separate ways (maybe you noticed but there is multiple times where Isaac can back out like when C gives him back the camera or when he apologises, C tries not to keep him and less arguably when C drove I to his home instead of his own) (urgh i hate the yaoi writing lol) but all of those recent events awaken feelings in him that he can't forget anymore. So he spends his week only thinking about that. At the end he cracks and goes to Cesare for admitting what he's been feeling. But when he opens the doors, he freaks out and pretends to have come here to apologise for the digging he did on Cesare!</span>
