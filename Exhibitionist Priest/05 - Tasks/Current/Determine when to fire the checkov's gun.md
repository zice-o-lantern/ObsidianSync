<span style="color:rgb(76, 58, 166)">Let's continue the discussion about the Gun's here</span>

<span style="color:rgb(232, 17, 93)"> I think if we fire it at the end of what we have now (IE Cesare using the moment Isaac takes a picture of him bent over) by having Cesare go through his pictures with Joseph, we can create a powerful moment that proves to Cesare that Isaac's mutual obsession is truly mutual, as he can find the old nude photos of himself with the camera that Isaac took. I think we discussed a little bit about this in the outline! But I felt the need to re-emphasize again within this proper note.

This can also help soothe any tension Isaac might have in not accepting the proposal to be mutual benefactors of their depravity. Knowing that Cesare is into Isaac the same way Isaac is into Cesare by confirming Cesare is alright with Isaac having taken pictures of him before allows us to engage with their partnership in a more realistic way, instead of it being more hesitant and thus leaving room for the audience to feel disconjointed. </span>

<span style="color:rgb(76, 58, 166)">I was thinking of concealing to the viewer the fact that he took multiple photos of Cesare beforehand and only showing the picture we explicitly told the viewer he took, could even more amplify the shock. I was thinking of making lucas go through the photos and realise that the relationship he thought was abusive only in one way was actually mutually fucked up

Also i thought the camera shattering when they were fighting  could be good symbolism to signify the turn of the page in Isaac's life. Like he won't be able to exert his urges with a tool or with a distance anymore. If he'll want to explore those urges, he'll have to either stop, or really put it into work.</span>

<span style="color:rgb(232, 17, 93)"> I do like this, it removes the safe shield that Isaac has created through use of a camera (a metaphorical and physical tool of providing distance from the subject). I think we break the camera, but not entirely, and leave the memory card intact. Then we can have the camera as a tool for use later, of course implicitly. If we _shatter_ the camera we cant use it, but if we just _break_ it it gives us a tool if we want to expose these photos to other characters later in the story :3 I think this plotpoint is good to work with and move to done now though!</span>

<span style="color:rgb(76, 58, 166)">Okay i agree with you! It will be just broken!</span>
