is this meant to be a fake out for the audience? Like, it's framed like it's cesare stalking joseph but it's actually Joseph taking pictures of Cesare? - murkwater
<span style="color:rgb(76, 58, 166)">I got this idea for amplifying the chekov's gun later in the story. But is that good?</span>

<span style="color:rgb(232, 17, 93)">I think we should write with this in mind at first, due to the vague nature of the incipit it would be easy to confirm/change later if we'd like to, otherwise I think youve done good framing - murkie</span>
