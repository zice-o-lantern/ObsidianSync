<span style="color:rgb(232, 17, 93)">lowkey i think im gonna try to watch some catholic media and get a grasp of this specific scenario I have in my head, I've seen before when the pastor/cure takes a new member or someone having a crisis of faith outside to talk about god. There's a lot we can do with the framing of this to fit the tropes of christian storytelling in a way while making it our own by giving it the romantic undercurrents. - murkwater</span>
