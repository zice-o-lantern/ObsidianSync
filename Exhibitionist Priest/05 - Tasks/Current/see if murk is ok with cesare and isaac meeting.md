<span style="color:rgb(232, 17, 93)">lowkey i think im gonna try to watch some catholic media and get a grasp of this specific scenario I have in my head, I've seen before when the pastor/cure takes a new member or someone having a crisis of faith outside to talk about god. There's a lot we can do with the framing of this to fit the tropes of christian storytelling in a way while making it our own by giving it the romantic undercurrents. - murkwater</span> 

<span style="color:rgb(76, 58, 166)">I seeeee tell me when you done! what were you thinking of particular ?</span> 

<span style="color:rgb(232, 17, 93)">So, I was thinking a walk around whatever little river/lake is near the church that you have to a secluded area, maybe forested, maybe just more "out of view", in order to give the reader a taste of the eventual full confessional that leads to Cesare taking Isaac's cock out. Pretty much we are creating a wholesome parallel for a later scene :3 I think a boat might be too involved if we went this route for a more natural setting, so a simple walk would be intimate and give Isaac time to admire Cesare for the length of time it takes to get out there, maybe letting him take a few pictures along the way :3</span>

<span style="color:rgb(76, 58, 166)">Oh yeah good idea, the stroll around the forested lake. Also it lets know the reader that cesare know about the camera. I think they can start relating on surface on common troubles that are, in surface, not related to their deviancies but very much is, eheh. Well to sum up I agree with you</span>
