<span style="color:rgb(76, 58, 166)">We have to develop it to show Cesare good side</span> (cf [The Crow and the Fox](https://read.gov/aesop/027.html))

I <span style="color:rgb(76, 58, 166)">was thinking of either Cesare could guide him around the Church or lead him into a tour boat  on the lake (if there is one) or maybe both</span>

<span style="color:rgb(232, 17, 93)"> One thing I was really considering is having Isaac's (now that we've decided names) female friend be the one to somewhat introduce the two. I think it works well with giving Isaac more multifaceted friends, a strong reason to (re)seek the church, and provides us with a perfect character to frame Cesare's good actions with. It gives Cesare a named, close character that he WANTS to be more normal towards. </span>

<span style="color:rgb(76, 58, 166)">yeah i added that to the outline</span>
