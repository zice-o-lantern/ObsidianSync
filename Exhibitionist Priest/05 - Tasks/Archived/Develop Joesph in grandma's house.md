<span style="color:rgb(232, 17, 93)">I will definitely need to see more of how the story unfolds before us before commenting on how to go about the development of the grooming. I think it's important we solidify and explore the later end parts of Cesare and Joseph's dynamic to get a feel for how to best approach this. - murkwater</span>
       
<span style="color:rgb(232, 17, 93)">I need to see how the rest of the story unfolds to gauge how much this plot thread feels throughout the story! So hard to have a full commentary on it from my perspective at the moment. I think write with this in mind, and we can judge it more thoroughly after we get further into the story. - murkwater</span> 

<span style="color:rgb(76, 58, 166)">to "justify" this plot point, i think i can tell you i have some some "knowledge" on this topic and also had to lived the guiltiness of having those experiences among a religious household. Also moké told me i should explicit this plot point to "justify" isaac's behaviour (being frightened/frozen) to cesare manipulative behaviour</span> 

<span style="color:rgb(232, 17, 93)">I don't think it needs to be explicit <i>yet</i> is my thing, it sort of front loads the plot when we should uncover more of these feelings later on. I'm not so much worried about justification but how thoroughly we want this to be explicit within the text or implicit within the background of Isaac.<br><br>Tbh I think anyone would be a bit pinned by Cesare's behavior if they have a reserved personality, but adding the layers to that as we go on through the story by having it be MORE THAN just a reserved personality thing from Isaac would service the flow of the story extremely well, and give the audience a more nuanced feel to the writing style.</span>

<span style="color:rgb(76, 58, 166)">Hmmm I see <br>tbh i wasn't intending on being explicit on the grooming here (i also like to be subtle) but moké reaction kinda scared me into people not understand why a 27yo guy would be frozen if someone acted like that with them</span> 

<span style="color:rgb(232, 17, 93)">I think if anyone is confused about why Isaac would act that way, if anything, should be taking that as part of the story to understand later. For those who are really like "a 27yr old wouldnt do this" it gives them a reason to keep that in their mind for later. Also, as a near 26 year old I feel like if an older priest was putting the moves on ME like THAT I would also be more of a "deer in headlights", which maybe speaks to my own past with weird stuff like that but also I feel like it's very normal. Most people are not super sexually confident, and readers will probably relate to Isaac's hesitant behavior in a sense of not immediately being into it or rejecting it immediately outright.</span> 

<span style="color:rgb(76, 58, 166)">Im glad we agree then. I'm just going to mention the camera belonged to the uncle then and don't make a flashback about that at this stage</span> 

<span style="color:rgb(232, 17, 93)">That is perfect. It makes the camera it's own form of a chekov's gun. You mention the camera, suddenly it becomes plot relevant, people will wonder why it was brought up and we will resolve that later within the story :3</span> 

<span style="color:rgb(76, 58, 166)">:3 changed it</span> 

<span style="color:rgb(232, 17, 93)">yay!</span>
