<span style="color:rgb(232, 17, 93)">Potential new plotline for Cesare: High ranking position within the church at the start of the story, currently vying for the highest position of head-of-church within his local chapter. Drama: He gets "sidetracked" from his larger goal after meeting Joseph, creating a strong reason for Joseph to doubt if he is doing Cesare any good by being involved within his life as well. Can emphasize the idea that they are "bad for eachother" on both ends, the indulgent Ouroborous.</span> 

<span style="color:rgb(76, 58, 166)">I approve this idea</span>
