<span style="color:rgb(232, 17, 93)">i think if we add another person for Joseph to bounce off, a female friend would be nice, or atleast someone not-male. I will have to keep a slot open in my mind if I see anything obvious as far as new friend introductory goes. - murkwater</span>

<span style="color:rgb(76, 58, 166)">Maybe it is now the right time at the party to introduce the friend?</span>

<span style="color:rgb(232, 17, 93)">Female friend encounter before Jospeh goes to church? Or maybe Joseph's female friend <i>already</i> is one of Cesare's flock? That could be <i>good</i> drama if we have atleast one character we know well who already knows Cesare as the image he has formed, while Joseph explores his darker depths potentially revealing them to a <i>member</i> of Cesare's church, who happens to be Joseph's friend. It can add a far higher risk situation for Cesare to be involved with Joseph and create some natural texture for Cesare to additionally hold back from allowing himself this divulgence into Joseph and vice versa! Something to think about atleast. - Murkwater</span>

<span style="color:rgb(76, 58, 166)">yeah i added that to the outline!</span>
