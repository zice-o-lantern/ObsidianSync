 When night falls, I adore everything about you: your piercing yet warm, intoxicating eyes! Your dark circles revealing all your sweetness and pain. Your sad face concealing a disturbing and perverse side, and above all, how much better you look through those binoculars. 

I revel in how you unbutton your shirt, your slender but precise hands always leaving a few chest hairs exposed. I bite my lip, my lord, I even pant. Then you take off your pants in one go, exhausted from the long day you've had. I'm not complaining. I savor this moment, I relish it, I gobble it up! What am I saying, I devour it. Then you stop, lost in thought. I take the opportunity to catch my breath. I adjust the blinds and put the binoculars back on my nose. Still thinking. How cute.

After that, below, comes the climax of the wait, hidden by that thin, exquisite fabric that struggles to cover that neglected bush and outlines the engine of all desires. You slip your hands into your boxers. I breathe through my teeth. I wipe my mouth. Drool drips from my hand. My heart is beating fast, my rib cage can no longer contain it, dancing, ricocheting off my ribs and leaping into my throat. I swallow.
I have to concentrate, I can't miss this moment. His boxers come down. My breath catches.

We're dancing a waltz. Unbeknownst to you. Isn't that what makes what we have so beautiful? With no one watching, you dance and I enjoy myself, in this forbidden moment. I revel in the thrill that at any moment, I could get caught. Be seen. In this moment, I am just a blind observer. An observer who perceives with his thirst, his desire. An observer with complete impunity. An observer who does not exist, from another world. An observer who is both blind and clairvoyant, that is what I am! Until... I am observed.
Look at me, God or Schrödinger, who knows! To You, so obsessed with the idea of opening the box without touching it. I have finally discovered how to do it.
I have finally discovered how to look into the box without compromising the divine state of the cat.
