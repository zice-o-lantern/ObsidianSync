- *Exhibition priest*. I kinda like the idea it sounds cool but maybe a bit too cheesy and blunt
- *Guilty pleasures*. It’s a good title but it lacks some spzaz.
- *The Guilty pleasures of Cesare Rothden* (temporary last name), maybe better stills lacks some spzaz
- *The Misery of Cesare Rothden*. Maybe a bit too edgy
