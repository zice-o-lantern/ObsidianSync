(1) I recommend a different term than urbanization, it usually carries negative connotations. It reads as though you mean he invests into social programs? Tap me if this is correct and I will correct the notes.

(2) while it emphasizes the depravity of the character, it might be better to make the language more specific when committing it to the story. Like, I imagine him jerking off at a park waiting for a late night jogger, somewhere he can target a specific audience/group of people (men/people coming home from work or at the park at night alr being a grown person activity). Maybe when we bring up his past in the VN, we can show images of him doing these actions so there's less room for the audience to run while (IE the priest peaking in on people and him getting caught in public being VN CGs). I think it would also emphasize his depravity well if we associated art with the acts instead of only telling the audience of this.

(3) Linger on this narratively, you can use it to pose a mystery that can reflect in the character. Building a sense of unease in the audience to get them to ask questions: why is Joseph going _so far_ to investigate Cesare? How familiar are we with _why_ Joseph's obsession manifests in such ways? Should the audience still be left in the dark on some details of Joseph's inner machinations so we can also uncover those as the story unfolds? You did well to set up a Chekov's gun in the undeleted photo of Cesare.

(4) Dont forget the Absolution! It is required at the end of a confessional, even if it ends early. I have provided a french version/modern translation (source in french: https://liturgie.catholique.fr/lexique/absolution/). The currently accepted prayer of absolution is this in english, it will be hard to find the older versions but possible if necessary:

 "_God, the Father of mercies,_

_through the death and resurrection of his Son_

_has reconciled the world to himself_

_and **poured out the Holy Spirit (formerly “sent the Holy Spirit among us”)** for the forgiveness of sins;_

_through the ministry of the Church_

_may God **grant (formerly “give”)** you pardon and peace._

_And I absolve you from your sins_

_in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit._"

(source: https://www.sjs.edu/blog/upcoming-changes-to-the-prayer-of-absolution)

	(4.5) I think the repetition of the prayer of absolution could compliment the themes of your story overall. Also ball sweat should drip onto Joseph :3?

(5) The term sinner used in this way feels a bit disjointed, I think we could use terms like heathen and heathenry, among other more specific language when we start implementation process. Leaving note for reminder.
	(5.5) Perhaps a more intense word like sodomite might work here, double edged sword that cuts them both but in a way that's sexually charged in a setting accurate way.

(6) I have specific thoughts about what images should be displayed here during this moment. I suggest _against_ revealing Joseph's _first_ naked images of Cesare if this is intended to be the moment Chekov's gun is fired. I think you can create more drama by revealing to Cesare that Joseph's psychosexual obsession has been going on for longer than their first direct interaction. There is an opportunity for providing Joseph the chance to take some sneaky pictures of Cesare's undercarriage during the confessional, creating an immediate confirmation that Joseph saw Cesare's genitals as he intended, thus saving your narrative bullet for later in the story for when Cesare gets more involved with Joseph's life.

(7) Cesare now has an established moment learning where Joseph lives. I havent seen the outline yet, but is this being set up as an opportunity for Cesare to peep on Joseph in his home? This could lead to a good opportunity in the future.

(8) Opportunity to be cheeky, don't specify that Cesare hasnt seen Joseph if you really mean it. If you leave out a detail, you could sneakily imply Cesare has been peeping/stalking Joseph in return to his original obsession considering Joseph gave Cesare an impassioned "No!". Flipping the dynamic that started the story by making Joseph the object of Cesare's obsession, complimenting the dark mirror analogy.
