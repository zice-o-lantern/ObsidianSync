Female friend encounter before Jospeh goes to church? Or maybe Joseph's female friend _already_ is one of Cesare's flock? That could be _good_ drama if we have atleast one character we know well who already knows Cesare as the image he has formed, while Joseph explores his darker depths potentially revealing them to a _member_ of Cesare's church, who happens to be Joseph's friend. It can add a far higher risk situation for Cesare to be involved with Joseph and create some natural texture for Cesare to additionally hold back from allowing himself this divulgence into Joseph and vice versa! Something to think about atleast. - Murkwater
